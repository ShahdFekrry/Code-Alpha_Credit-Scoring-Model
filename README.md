# Code-Alpha_Credit-Scoring-Model


This project aims to predict loan approval based on various features such as applicant's age, income, employment length, loan amount, etc. The prediction model is built using machine learning techniques, specifically an XGBOOST classifier model.
## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about loan applicants including their age, income, home ownership status, loan intent, loan grade, loan amount, interest rate, loan status, and other relevant features. It is stored in a CSV file named `credit_risk_dataset.csv`.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset `credit_risk_dataset.csv`.
- `notebook/`: This directory contains colab notebook used for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project, its structure, and instructions for running the code.

## Getting Started
